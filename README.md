# Introduction
Forus is a platform that brings together sponsors, providers, requesters and validators. The sponsor makes funds available to the applicant. The requester applies to a fund and waits for approval. As soon as the validator agrees, the applicant will receive a voucher. He or she can redeem this voucher at a participating provider. The transaction goes through the [Me app](https://github.com/teamforus/me).
